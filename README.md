# 🧠 Brainrot.js

> Turning simple problems into intricate futility since 2025.

## 🤔 What is this?

**Brainrot.js** is a collection of overcomplicated, redundant, and utterly unnecessary implementations of basic programming tasks. If a problem can be solved in two lines, don't worry... We'll make sure it takes at least twenty

This project is an **open-source experiment in inefficiency**, a challenge for developers to create the most absurdly convoluted yet technically functional code possible.

## 🔥 Worst Practices Guideline

✅ Functions that do simple things in the most useless and unnecessary way possible  
✅ Unnecessary layers of abstraction  
✅ Prefer TypeScript, because every `string` should be a `RedundantStringObject<string>`  
✅ Absolutely no regard for best practices

📜 The Brainrot Manifesto

1. If it can be done in 2 lines, do it in 20.
2. If there is a simple solution, choose the most convoluted one.
3. Every function should have at least 3 layers of abstraction.
4. **The code must be unnecessarily complex, but elegantly structured**.
5. Performance optimizations are strictly prohibited.
6. Documentation should sound serious, but be completely useless.

## 🏗 Project Structure

Feel free to add your own contribution to the madness by creating a folder within /src following the pattern below:

```
/src
  /github-user-your-contribution # (GitHub User + Solution)
    - your-script.ts  # Your utterly unnecessary solution to a problem
  /guisoaresdev-completely-random-but-not-really-loop
    - random-loop.ts: A loop that pretends to be random, but it’s just a sham.
```

You are free to choose any language you'd like (but let’s be honest, JavaScript/TypeScript will provide the best brainrot)! The main goal is to make something work in the most convoluted way possible.

## 🚀 Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/guisoaresdev/brainrot.js.git
cd brainrot.js
npm install
```

## 🛠 Usage

```
npm run brainrot
```

## 🤡 Contributing
Want to contribute to the madness? Feel free to submit a PR! Just follow these simple guidelines:

Your code must be inconveniently stupid, not even complex.
If it's complex, it should remain readable. (We need to understand to have some HAHA's you know...)
Unnecessary layers of abstraction are highly encouraged.
